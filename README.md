# MY DOT FILES

- clone this repo to root `~`

- each application has its own way to source its config files. i'll try to add a comment each config to document how to source

### TODO:
- create a bash script to automate config sourcing
- create a bash script to automate installing each application
    - use docker to test that the bash script installs (instead of manually uninstalling things lol)
